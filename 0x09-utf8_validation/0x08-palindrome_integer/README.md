Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

Prototype: int is_palindrome(unsigned long n);
Where n is the number to be checked
Your function must return 1 if n is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
You are not allowed to allocate memory dynamically (malloc, calloc, â€¦)

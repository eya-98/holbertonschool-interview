**function that computes the sum of two sandpiles**
Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);  
You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable  
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains  
When your function is done, grid1 must be stable  
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable
